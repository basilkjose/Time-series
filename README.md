## TIME SERIES FORECASTING
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations.
